## üå≥ Treedle - Wordle Clone in MAUI .NET

Treedle is a fun and challenging word puzzle game inspired by the popular game "Wordle." This Wordle clone is written using MAUI .NET, a powerful and modern framework for building cross-platform applications. With Treedle, players can test their word-solving skills and enjoy hours of entertainment.

## üéÆ How to Play
1. **Objective:** The goal of Treedle is to guess a five-letter word in as few attempts as possible.

1. **Gameplay:** In each round, you'll enter a five-letter word into the input field and click the "Submit" button. The game will then provide feedback:

    - A letter highlighted in üü¢ green indicates that the letter is present in the word, and it's in the correct position.
    - A letter highlighted in üü° yellow indicates that the letter is present in the word but is in the wrong position.
    - A letter that is not highlighted means that the letter is not part of the word.
1. **Strategy:** Use the feedback provided by the game to narrow down the possibilities and guess the correct word within the given attempts.
